# UNet for Rock Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of a UNet model for rock segmentation. The model is trained and evaluated using a custom dataset of rock images and their corresponding segmentation masks. This README provides detailed instructions on how to set up, train, and evaluate the model, as well as how to run inference on new images and videos.
